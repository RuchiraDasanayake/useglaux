/**
 * three gets a named chunk of its own so the build output is legible; it is
 * still fetched only via the lazily imported hero canvas.
 *
 * @react-three and three-stdlib are deliberately NOT pinned. Left to
 * automatic splitting, the glTF/Draco/Meshopt loaders land in the OwlModel
 * chunk, which is dormant unless VITE_OWL_MODEL_URL is set. Pinning them by
 * name drags roughly 70 kB of decoder machinery into the chunk that every
 * visitor with WebGL downloads, and pinning fiber specifically also pulls
 * three back out of its own chunk and into the combined one.
 *
 * The consequence is that the shared fiber/drei chunk takes its name from
 * owlGeometry, the first-party module both hero entry points import. The name
 * is cosmetic; the split is the point.
